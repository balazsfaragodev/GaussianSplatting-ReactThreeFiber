# React Three Fiber Tutorial + TypeScript + Gaussian Splatting

## Exploring Gaussian Splatting with React Three Fiber

In this project, we're leveraging React Three Fiber, TypeScript, and Vite to craft an interactive comparison between a Gaussian splatting object and a GLB file. This approach enables a detailed visualization of the differences and similarities between these two types of 3D models.

### Keywords: Gaussian Splatting, React Three Fiber, TypeScript, Vite, three.js, 3D Visualization

## The end result

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a dynamic 3D scene that showcases Gaussian splatting. This technique allows us to create more realistic and visually striking representations of particle systems and materials. It's a fantastic showcase of React Three Fiber's capabilities when it comes to rendering complex visual effects in a web application.
